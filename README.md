## C game programming

- [ ] [Handmade Quake videos](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/l6nqvbl5v0snbd7vo2c7x/AHnBbVV6SUDYIJPSH_jGfaQ?rlkey=osvqri75z18xcds8tsi31enfg&e=1&dl=0) and [source code](https://github.com/Kobzol/handmade-quake)
- [ ] [Kohi Game Engine videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv8Ddw9K0JPg1BEO-RS-0MYs423cvLVtj)
- [ ] Make a game, taking inspiration from [high_impact](https://phoboslab.org/log/2024/08/high_impact), [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), [Box2D 3.x](https://github.com/erincatto/box2c) (or see [box2d-raylib](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d-raylib))
  - Or make a text-based game: see [How to program a text adventure in C](https://helderman.github.io/htpataic/htpataic01.html) and [Knuth's C port of Colossal Cave Adventure](http://www.literateprogramming.com/adventure.pdf) (which, incidentally, is an example of *literate programming*, now reincarnated in [Entangled](https://entangled.github.io/))
